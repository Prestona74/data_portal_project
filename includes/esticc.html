eSTICC is a Nordic Centre of Excellence (NCoE) funded by NordForsk. eSTICC stands for “eScience Tools for Investigating Climate Change at High Northern Latitudes” and aims for a more accurate description of the high-latitude feedback processes in the climate system by improving the eScience tools for the climate research community.
<br/>
<br/>
eSTICC has pooled together researchers from 13 top institutes in the Nordic countries working in the fields of climate and/or eScience to improve eScience tools for climate research. Specifically, eSTICC will develop tools needed for more efficient use of experimental and model data, and improve the computational efficiency and coding standards of Earth System Models (ESMs) and tools for inverse modeling of emission fluxes.
